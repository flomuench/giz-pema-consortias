### Title
'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations

### Description

ietoolkit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly appreciated. The commands were developed to standardize and simplify best practices across the World Bank's unit for Impact Evaluations (DIME). They are developed to be applicable to different contexts, but some might not apply to practices adopted at other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help files provide justifications for the standardized practices applied. See https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit and https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices for more details.

### What are keywords?
This is an explanation to the keywords used below. I do not know how frequently they are used, but this is a list of keywords that are searchable. So if you search on _field work_ (but I do not know where you do that search) you should find this command as it is one of the keywords.
